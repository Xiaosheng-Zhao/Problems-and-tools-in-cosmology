# Problems-and-tools-in-cosmology
In this repository, I aimed to collect the big as well as interesting problems, and the cutting-edge tools used in cosmology.

## Big problems in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR)
### Theoretical ones
* When does the EoR start.
* What is the knowledge about the first black holes (theoretical and statistical).
* When does the first star and galaxy in the universe form.
* If the reionization is patchy or not.
* what is the relation between the black holes and EoR.
* What is the relation between the inflation theory and EoR.

### Instrumental ones
* The foreground simulation and removal.
* The instrumental callibration.
* High-speed data-processing tools.
